### What is **Equivalence** in Databases?

In the context of databases, **equivalence** refers to two or more **sets of functional dependencies** (FDs) that essentially express the **same information** in different forms. In simpler terms, two sets of FDs are considered **equivalent** if they can derive the same results or consequences, even though they may look different at first.

### In Simple Terms:
Equivalence in databases means that two sets of **functional dependencies** (or even two **queries**) will produce the **same outcome**, even though they may look different. You can use one in place of the other without changing the data or the results.

### Equivalence of Functional Dependencies:
Two sets of functional dependencies (FDs) are considered **equivalent** if each set can **infer the other**. This means that if you can use the functional dependencies in one set to **derive** the functional dependencies in the other set, then the two sets are **equivalent**.

For example:

Let’s say we have two sets of functional dependencies:

- **Set 1**: 
  1. **A → B**
  2. **B → C**

- **Set 2**: 
  1. **A → C**
  2. **C → B**

Even though the two sets have different functional dependencies, they are **equivalent** because you can derive the functional dependencies of one set from the other.

### How Do We Check Equivalence?
We can check if two sets of functional dependencies are equivalent by using the following principles:
1. **Deriving each FD**: Try to use one set of FDs to derive the FDs in the other set. If this works, then the sets are equivalent.
2. **Closure method**: For each set, compute the **closure** of the functional dependencies and see if they lead to the same result.

### Example of Functional Dependency Equivalence:

Consider the following two sets of functional dependencies:

- **Set 1**:
  1. **A → B**
  2. **B → C**

- **Set 2**:
  1. **A → C**
  2. **B → A**

#### Checking Equivalence:

- From **Set 1**, we have **A → B** and **B → C**.
  - **A → B** tells us that if we know **A**, we can find **B**.
  - **B → C** tells us that if we know **B**, we can find **C**.
  - Using **transitivity**, **A → C** can be derived (A → B → C).

- Now, if we check **Set 2**: 
  1. **A → C** is already given.
  2. **B → A** tells us that if we know **B**, we can find **A**.

By using **Set 2**, we can derive **A → C** and **B → C** (using **A → B** and **B → C**), which matches the **Set 1** results.

Hence, **Set 1** and **Set 2** are **equivalent** because both sets can be used to derive the same information.

### Summary:
- **Equivalence** means two sets of dependencies or queries give the same result, even if they are written differently.
- Checking for equivalence involves ensuring that you can derive the dependencies of one set from the other.
