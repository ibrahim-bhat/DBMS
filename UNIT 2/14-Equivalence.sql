### **Equivalence in DBMS**

In **DBMS (Database Management System)**, **equivalence** refers to when two queries or expressions produce the **same result** despite being written differently. They might use different methods or operations, but the output remains identical.

### **Types of Equivalence**

1. **Relational Algebra Equivalence:**
   - Two relational algebra expressions give the same result when applied to the same database.

2. **Query Equivalence:**
   - Two SQL queries return the same set of records, even if written differently.

### **Example of Equivalence**

#### **Relational Algebra Equivalence:**

Expression 1:  
Select students with age > 20, then project their names:  
\[ \pi_{name}(\sigma_{age > 20}(Students)) \]

Expression 2:  
Project the names of all students, then select where age > 20:  
\[ \sigma_{age > 20}(\pi_{name, age}(Students)) \]

Both produce the same result: names of students older than 20.

#### **SQL Query Equivalence:**

Query 1:  
SELECT name FROM students WHERE age > 20;

Query 2:  
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM students WHERE age > 20;
-- the DISTINCT keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the query result. It ensures that each row in the output is unique.

If the `name` column has unique values, both queries give the **same output**, so they are **equivalent**.

### **Easy Analogy**

Equivalence in DBMS is like solving a math problem in two different ways but getting the same answer. For example:  
- \( 2 + 3 = 5 \)  
- \( 1 + 4 = 5 \)  
Both methods are different but equivalent because they result in 5.
